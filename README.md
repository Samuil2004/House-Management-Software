# Housing Application

# This is a software developed by myself for a Student Hosing Agency. It uses C# OOP,properties,classes,objects,SQL,etc. If You need the Database information ( you need it in order to successfully run the code) message me at s.kozarov23@acsbg.org

## This project is developed for a company which owns lots of flats that are rented to university students. My aim was to make a desktop app that will help flatmates to do their tasks by having a weekly calendar, write complaints/feedback, see garbage schedules and have the opportunity to make a grocery list with products which should be bought. As in most dormitories, the landlords receive many complaints from some of their clients:
- Groceries are not done or paid for shared items such as toilet paper, dirty dishes etc.
- Appointed persons don’t clean the shared facilities.
- Garbage disposal is not done on time.
- Unannounced parties, gatherings, etc.
- The well-being of some of the flatmates is damaged.

I can offer an application for every tenant to solve these problems. This app provides:
A well-developed flat managing software which allows flatmates to share common information related to their well-being in the rented place;
Prevention of future unexpected and unpleasant events to happen in the apartment;
Easier management for the landlords;


To date, the entire program has been completed, which will solve problems for tenants in the shared facilities. Our program can offer:
Rules page, which can be modified in the future;
Anonymous complaints function, to let people express their opinion and don’t be afraid of the consequences of their remarks;
List of groceries to know which product must be bought for each apartment;
Garbage disposal schedule, which will help them visually see who should take out the trash and when;
A weekly schedule of tasks, their user can add himself/herself or a random person from his/her apartment to complete the task. It will be easier to keep track of tasks with this schedule
Expenses for communal consumptions, which are added to tasks and must be paid every week until Friday;
Events in the apartment that should be added by the person who will have them;
Login and signup pages for new people at the apartment;
Admin page for landlords, there they can see all complaints, users, events and undone and expired tasks.
